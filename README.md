<h1>Cybersecurity Incident Management</h1>

## SThreat Intelligence & Adversary Profiling

### Project Context:

The CRC, part of the global Movement, delivers critical humanitarian services including disaster response, blood donation services, and family reunification for people affected by conflict and natural disasters. In support of these services, the organization collects and processes highly sensitive personal data related to donors, volunteers, beneficiaries, refugees, and missing persons. Trust, neutrality, and ethical stewardship of data are foundational to the organization’s mission. To enhance service delivery and operational efficiency, the CRC is actively expanding its digital footprint through the use of AI-enabled systems and advanced digital platforms. While these technologies accelerate humanitarian aid, they simultaneously broaden the organization’s attack surface and increase its cyber risk exposure.

The humanitarian sector has become a high-value target for sophisticated threat actors, including state-sponsored groups and cybercriminals. The urgency of this project was underscored by the 2022 International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) data breach, which compromised the sensitive information of over 500,000 vulnerable individuals. For the CRC, a cybersecurity failure is not merely a technical issue; it is a humanitarian risk that can lead to severe ethical breaches, loss of life-saving trust, and significant reputational damage.

<br />

In response to the escalating cyber threats facing the humanitarian sector, this engagement delivered a comprehensive Cybersecurity and GRC Transformation for the Canadian Red Cross. By bridging the gap between technical requirements and humanitarian values, the project established a three-year strategic roadmap that prioritized the protection of highly sensitive data—including records for refugees and disaster victims. Key achievements included a 30% reduction in the organization’s digital attack surface through data minimization, the implementation of a specialized Incident Response Plan for field operations, and the creation of the organization’s first Ethical AI Governance Framework. The result was a resilient security posture that ensures technology serves as a safe enabler for life-saving aid.


### Project Objectives (My Role):
The goal of this engagement was to design a structured Cybersecurity and GRC framework tailored to the unique needs of a non-profit entity. The approach focused on balancing rigorous security controls with the organization's humanitarian values and inherent resource constraints, ensuring that digital transformation does not compromise the safety of the people the CRC serves. The core scope included:

GRC Maturity Assessment: Evaluating current policies against international standards while accounting for the unique operational needs of a non-profit.

AI Governance Framework: Establishing guardrails for the ethical use of AI in service delivery and disaster response.

Incident Response Strategy: Developing a specialized response plan that prioritizes the safety of vulnerable populations during a data breach.

#### Methodology:
A four-phased approach was utilized to ensure that security measures enhanced, rather than hindered, the CRC’s humanitarian mission:

Ethical Discovery & Risk Profiling: Identified the humanitarian impact of data loss to define specific risks to beneficiaries.

Framework Alignment: Mapped the environment against NIST CSF and ISO 27001 to address gaps in access control and third-party risk (crucial for global NGO partnerships).

GRC Policy Optimization: Drafted a suite of GRC policies that focused on Data Minimization—ensuring the CRC only collects what is necessary for service delivery. This reduced the "target value" of the organization’s databases. I also integrated AI Ethics into the IT governance structure to ensure automated systems do not inadvertently bias aid distribution.

Strategic Roadmap: Delivered a tiered implementation plan that prioritized immediate "quick wins" while accounting for non-profit resource constraints.

<h2>Tools and Utilities Used</h2>

- <b>Interviews, Google Docs, MS Excel, MS Project, COBIT 2019 Framework, NIST CSF 2.0, ISO 27001, PIPEDA, GDPR, MS PowerPoint </b> 

<h2>Key Challenges & Strategic Solutions</h2>
<b>Navigating the intersection of humanitarian aid and high-level cybersecurity presented several unique hurdles. Here is how I addressed them:</b>

- Resource Constraints: Maximized ROI by applying a "Risk-First" approach, utilizing open-source frameworks and low-cost/high-impact controls (like MFA) to protect critical refugee databases without diverting funds from frontline aid.<br />
- Operational Accessibility: Humanitarian workers often operate in disaster zones with poor connectivity and a need for rapid data access. Overly restrictive security protocols can hinder life-saving work. I implemented Context-Aware Governance. This meant designing security policies that were flexible enough for field operations (e.g., offline-first secure data entry) but rigid enough to protect the central data core. We shifted the narrative from "Security is a blocker" to "Security is an enabler of trust. Solved the conflict between rigid security and disaster-zone realities through Context-Aware Governance, ensuring security protocols remained flexible for field workers while maintaining a hardened data core.<br />
- The Trust Gap: Overcame resistance to digital transformation by leading transparency workshops that framed data protection as a digital extension of the humanitarian principle "Do No Harm.<br />
- Asymmetric Threats: Addressed the risk of state-sponsored targeting by prioritizing resilience and specialized incident response, ensuring encrypted data protection and rapid recovery during humanitarian crises.<br />

The project successfully transitioned the CRC from a reactive security posture to a structured, risk-aware organization
<h2>Lessons Learned & Strategic Reflections</h2>
<b>Several key insights were gained during the engagement that will inform future large-scale GRC transformations in the non-profit and humanitarian sectors.</b>

- Mission-Linked Security: Found that linking technical controls directly to the humanitarian mission drives faster adoption; future projects should lead with Humanitarian Impact Assessments. I would introduce "Humanitarian Impact Assessments" even earlier in the process to ensure every security policy is viewed through the lens of beneficiary safety rather than just IT compliance.<br />
- Agile AI Governance: Recognized that rapid AI evolution requires a "Living Governance" model with quarterly agile reviews rather than static annual policies.<br />
Prioritizing Field UX: Identified that security must be frictionless for aid workers; future iterations would include "Security UX" testing to ensure protocols don't impede life-saving response times.<br />
- Automated Third-Party Risk: Learned that manual vendor assessments are a bottleneck for global NGOs, highlighting the need for automated TPRM platforms for real-time risk scoring.<br />
- Culture as a Core Control: Confirmed that Security Awareness and Culture (SAC) is as vital as technical infrastructure, as the most lasting impact came from a shift in how staff valued data.<br />

Public Engagement: Deploying AI chatbots for donor, volunteer, and trainee intake.
Disaster Response: Utilizing predictive modelling to forecast natural disasters, optimize support center placement, and tailor emergency training.
Efficiency: Streamlining cloud development through AI coding support and automating marketing content creation.
  
<br/>
Critical AI Security Priorities:
Data Integrity: Preventing unauthorized access to sensitive donor and patient records.
Algorithmic Fairness: Ensuring models provide unbiased decisions in healthcare and aid distribution.
System Resilience: Protecting AI infrastructure from tampering or exploitation by malicious actors

<br />
Identified Strategic Risks:
Vulnerability Exposure: Preventing data leaks caused by AI-generated code that may contain errors or security gaps.
Decision Bias: Mitigating the risk of inappropriate or unethical aid delivery driven by biased data models.
Advanced Threats: Countering sophisticated actors who use AI to reverse-engineer code or identify "back-door" entries into CRC’s protected systems.

<br />

In terms of compliance requirements, the CRC must adhere to the following regulations to ensure the protection and ethical use of data in AI applications:

● PIPEDA (Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act) - Governs how Canadian private sector organizations handle personal information.<br />
● PHIPA (Personal Health Information Protection Act): Ontario law that governs the collection and use of personal health information by healthcare providers.<br />
● CASL (Canada’s Anti-Spam Legislation) regulates the sending of commercial electronic messages and the installation of computer programs without consent.<br />
● PCI-DSS (Payment Card Industry Standard - Data Security Standard) - Sets out guidelines for managing card payment data.<br />
